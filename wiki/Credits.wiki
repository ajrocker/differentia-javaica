== Generama ==

I found interesting stuff in Generama project:

http://generama.codehaus.org/

There is ASTTestCase however it supports only Java 1.4 syntax :( ASTTestCase is using Java parser generated with ANTLR project. It seemed easy to upgrade.

== ANTLR ==

http://www.antlr.org/

ANTLR stands for ANother Tool for Language Recognition, perfect tool for building parsers for any possible languages. In our case it produces so called Abstract Syntax Tree.

== JSourceObjectizer ==

This project provides very handy ANTLRv3 AST grammar for Java 1.5, which is used in differentia-javaica project
