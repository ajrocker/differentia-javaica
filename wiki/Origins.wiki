== Code generation ==

For purpose of one project developed at <a href="http://www.ncdc.pl/>NCDC</a>, we had to write Java source code generator. Soon we realized that it would be very nice to have unit tests verifying generated output. Something which would compare results to predefined sources with content form expected for specific input arguments.

*differentia-javaica* is the final result of these efforts. [Credits] will tell you what influenced the development.
